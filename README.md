Description:
foodSpot is a collaborative project completed as the final endeavor of our fullstack bootcamp, designed to showcase our acquired skills. This web application revolutionizes how users discover and choose restaurants, offering a unique, community-driven approach to restaurant searching.

Technologies:
The project was developed using technologies like Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate. MapStruct was utilized for efficient object-relational mapping, while Mockito supported our testing efforts. Integrating Google OAuth2 provided a simple and secure login method.

Key Features:

Community-Driven Restaurant Discovery: Users can discover restaurants using various tags, promoting spots that are popular within the community rather than those with the highest advertising budgets.
Restaurant Contributions: Every user can add new restaurants, fostering community growth and sharing of favorite spots.
Interactive Map and Detailed Information: An interactive map, along with detailed descriptions and menus of restaurants, assists users in making informed choices.
Challenges and Solutions:
Implementing Google OAuth2 for login presented a challenge, particularly regarding security and integration with the existing system. Additionally, employing Hibernate Criteria Builder allowed for complex filtering in search functionality, which was critical for the application.

Summary:
The foodSpot project exemplifies successful collaboration among a group of developers, resulting in an application with significant impact on the user community. It demonstrates our ability to work as a team, think innovatively, and execute advanced technological solutions.
